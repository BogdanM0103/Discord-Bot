This is a simple Discord Bot that runs on your machine.

The bot works only when the python program is running.

If your message in the Discord Server chat looks like "#{message}", the bot will take the "{message}" and convert each character to an emoji.

The emoji's are taken from the dictionary found in the emojiConverter.py file.

IMPORTANT!!!!!!

In order for the bot to work, you have to create a ".env" file inside your project folder where you write this:

DISCORD_TOKEN={your bot's token}

To find your bot's token, go to https://www.discord.com/developers/ -> click on your bot -> Bot on the left side of the page -> Reset token
